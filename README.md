# CSE527MatlabCode
This repo has my assignment code for CSE 527:

1. Circle Detection
2. Classification of scene- Big Bang Theory images
3. Image warping and mosaicing
4. Template tracker and Subtract dominant motion

Assignment 2 is my first attempt with CNNs. We used Vpretrained GG16 model for this transfer learning- added a Convolutional layer and a softmax layerfor the classification task. 

Here is a great tutorial available at: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/practicals/cnn/index.html . I think it explains everything in great detail. 

It was a Kaggle- in class contest in which I came 7 out of all 45 odd class students.
